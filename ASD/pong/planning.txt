Describe the gameplay:
    
    There are two players and one ball. Each player hits the ball in turn, attempting to make their opponent miss.
    When the opponent misses, the other player gets a point. 


What are the conditions when the game begins?
    When the game begins, both players have their point counter set to zero and the ball begins in the middle
    of the screen.

Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?

    The game ends when one player has reached 11 points.

What ifs will there be?


Visual Game Components:
What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box
    Two paddles (animated)
    One ball (animated)
    Two score boxes (animated)
    
Which will be static? (the board)

What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.

    positionX and positionY of the ball
    positionY for the paddles since they only move vertically
    speedX and speedY
    points for each player
    
Events / Logic
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)

    up and down/w and s to move the paddles (keydown/keyup)
    setInterval to check position
    collision events to check for collision with the ball and walls
    
How do those events affect the data of the program?
    Moves the game components
    increases score

For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

When keys are pressed:
1. the paddle moves up or down

When collision is detected:
1. If the ball collides with the left or right wall, it is a point for the player who hit the ball. The player's counter increases and the ball is reset to the middle of the screen.
2. If the ball collides with the paddle or top or bottom wall, it bounces back toward the opponent
